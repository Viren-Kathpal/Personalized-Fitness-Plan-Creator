What are .pyc Files?
.pyc files are compiled Python files. They contain the bytecode that results from the compilation of Python source code files (.py files). 

Compilation Process:
When a Python script is run, the Python interpreter compiles the source code (.py files) into bytecode, which is a lower-level, platform-independent representation of the source code.
This bytecode is then executed by the Python virtual machine (PVM).

Purpose of .pyc Files:
Efficiency: Compiling Python code to bytecode improves performance because the Python interpreter can skip the compilation step on subsequent runs.
Faster Startup: When the source code is already compiled, the interpreter can load the bytecode directly from the .pyc file, which speeds up the startup time of the program.
Automatic Generation:

Python automatically generates .pyc files when a module is imported.
These files are usually stored in a special directory called __pycache__ within the directory containing the original .py files.
Structure of .pyc Files:

Header: Contains metadata, such as the Python version number and a timestamp or hash of the source file.
Bytecode: The compiled bytecode instructions that the Python interpreter executes.

Usage:
Transparency: Users typically donâ€™t need to manage .pyc files manually; the Python interpreter handles their creation and loading.
Cross-Version Compatibility: .pyc files are specific to the Python version that created them. Bytecode can change between Python versions, so .pyc files generated by one version of Python may not be usable by another version.
